Idea:
"Just in" BOOST - each new article would have huge boost as they are added to the feed. 
If and only if they article shares more then 1 or 2 keywords with the profile get huge boost in score. But this boost would decay with number of times article was actually displayed in the feed. Parameter deciding about VIEWCOUNT DECAY should be. With each view this value would be decremented by 1 until it reaches 0 at which point final score would reach its regular value and place in newsfeed ranking.

This way feed would be less stagnant and more interesting. 
The question is how not to push all new arrivals to the top for few views creating chaos and inconsistancy in the newsfeed, but rather only selected few, which would have some chance of being interesting for the user despite not having the highest score. 
Also we could also reward interactions more then regular on the article which have it's boost score high (not decayed yet) - this would mean that user got pleasantly surprised which something that he wouldn't probably even notice that easily if it wasn't for "Just in" BOOST.
